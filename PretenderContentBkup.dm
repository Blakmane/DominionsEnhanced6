The chosen child is blinded and rendered unable to do anything but speak the will of the spirit. At the age of thirteen, she is sacrificed and replaced with a new girl, born the day the previous girl was made the voice of the spirit. The unholy spirit is immobile and cannot leave the fountain it inhabits. It can possess willing targets to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The Fountain of Blood is tremendously strong in its Dominion and magically powerful. Its eerie wails attract weak souls each month including those of pure blood, and the unholy spirit is most efficient in finding virgins for sacrifice. Anyone wishing to harm the fountain will flee in panic once the eerie wailing pierces his soul. The fountain can be destroyed, but not easily."

When he made an attempt on a mistress of the Pantokrator he was trapped in a magic forest for eternity, with beasts as only company. In the enchanted forest primordial beasts were also bound. The Golden Boar, the Ram-Headed Serpent and the Great White Stag pledged the Horned One their service. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Horned One has found a way out of his woodland prison to once more revel in the world with beasts and men. He is highly resilient and will suffer permanent injuries less often than most creatures."

The primordial water of Apsu caressed the under-earth and a giant woman formed in the Womb of the Earth. Given life and purpose by the Pantokrator, she was charged with caring for the under-earth. But she fell in love with the subterranean lifeforms and was seduced by the eldest Olm and gave birth to strange amphibian humanoids with external gills and cyclops eyes. At first the Pantokrator tolerated her misstep, and she helped him form the Seal that must not be Broken. But the making of the Seal demanded a huge sacrifice of her progeny, and she demanded compensation for her kin. Angry with her impudence he imprisoned her for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone her prison is weakening, but so is the Seal. In combat the Earth Made Flesh can manifest magical Earth and Water gems to aid in spellcasting"

The One Death shared his powers with nine lieutenants, the Bolon-ti-ku, the Nine-Gods, and with their aid he slew his brother and ended the cycle of death and rebirth. With the breach of the natural order set up by the Pantokrator the world became depopulated, wild and inhospitable. The world was plunged into darkness and the dead threatened to replace the living. The Pantokrator became furious and punished his rebellious servant with eternal imprisonment.

#descr "The Wadjet, Green One, is a Great Serpent born at the dawn of time, when monsters and giants roamed the world. It made the sacred river its home and became worshiped as protector of the land and a bringer of annual prosperity. During the rebellion of the lesser gods the great serpent remained neutral and tried to protect its subjects from the madness of warring gods. When the Great Antagonist was defeated the Pantokrator imprisoned every spirit and monster that hadn't fought against the Enemy. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the shackles of the eternal prison is weakening and the Great Serpent is preparing to return to the sacred river and the beings that dwell there. Great Serpents can shed their skin and regenerate their wounds, and the Green One is no exception."

With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshiped as a reawakening god. Fossilized warriors buried deep in the earth are now beginning to stir and will emerge to serve the statue as its Dominion grows strong. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."

#descr "The Titan of the Hunt is a giant of divine heritage born at the dawn of time times. She became a huntress of primordial beasts and was entrusted by a previous Pantokrator to care for the wilderness. He gave her a golden bow and authority over the animals of the wild. But mankind began to make offerings to the Huntress and she let herself be worshipped and promised mankind that she would protect the huntsmen and the unmarried women of the world. The Pantokrator sent his servants to punish her for her breach of trust, but she transformed herself into a deer and escaped into the First Forest. Here she met another of the Pantokrator's servants and he gave her hounds to aid her in the Hunt. The Pantokrator was furious and trapped them both in the forest for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the paths of the First Forest are once more open and the Titan of the Hunt can once more hear the prayers of young women and huntsmen. With primordial monsters emerging anew the Titan of the Hunt has taken it upon herself to rid the world of monsters and claim the world as hers. The Titan of the Hunt is always accompanied by her sacred hounds, as well as animals of the wild. She wields a golden bow created by the Titan of the Forge that will always strike the heart of any target, and in combat she can manifest nature gems to aid in spellcasting."

Her blessings and gifts to mankind were numerous and she brought fertility and life to the world. When her daughter was abducted by the Great Adversary she was devastated and abandoned her tasks and all life withered and died. The Pantokrator was furious, imprisoned her for eternity and gave the dominion of growth to a better suited candidate. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Titan of Growth can return to the world and reclaim her former glory and possibly find her missing daughter. The province where the Titan dwells will be lush and the harvest will be extraordinary, granting thirty percent additional tax revenue to the treasury. In combat she will manifest gems of Earth and Nature magic to aid in spellcasting."

In ages past it lived in the center of a great woodland and brought life and growth to the forest, however with the coming of Man the forest was burned and the tree withered and died. For long years the spirit was trapped within the dead trunk as insects burrowed into its rotting form. Now, with disappearance of the Pantokrator it has emerged to take on the mantle of a Pretender God and exact vengeance upon the world of men. The spirit can animate the tree to defend against attackers or perform tasks such as forging items, but it cannot uproot and move around. It is powerful in its Dominion, however in a physical battle it would be possible to chop down the tree."

Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Bodhisattva is ready to resume his quest for ascension and to bring hope and solace to mankind. Though he is not physically as powerful as many other divine beings, the Bodhisattva has a strong dominion and is a powerful Astral mage because of his spiritual perfection. Furthermore, his aspect is such that few would dare to strike him, and his mere presence instills serenity in the hearts of mortals. In one hand he bears the sword of truth, which cuts through falsehood and destroys ignorance, and in the other he holds the stem of a lotus flower upon which is written a book on the attainment of transcendent wisdom."

He is among the first of the children of Iblis and his sovereignty over the Jinn was uncontested until the rise of the Ifrit and the War of the Unseen. After losing his throne he was banished from the City of Brass along with his brethren and closest servants. Fleeing, they found the Emerald mountain and settled there out of sight of the Ifrit and their lackeys until the divine decree that sealed the gates of Ubar. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, he is free to use his vast magics to claim godhood and restore the kingdom of the Jinn to glory."

Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Vermillion Bird is breaking free to once again protect its subjects by donning the mantle of God itself. It is perpetually covered in flames and will be stronger in hotter conditions and weaker in the cold. The Vermillion Bird is associated with the South and Summer and is stronger in the warmer months. Its flames burn so brightly that most creatures will hesitate to strike it."

As she roared and smote in the chaos of original creation the Serpent gave birth to a multitude of monsters through the mixing of salt and fresh water. Soon the Pantokrator discovered a plot by the serpent to use her offspring in a war against him and he punished her with eternal imprisonment. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Primordial Serpent has returned to creation to fill it with her monstrous children. Whilst she is beneath the waves monstrous creatures will occasionally be born to the serpent as her Dominion grows strong."

It once slept beneath a great lake by an ancient city and was worshipped by the strange beings that dwelled upon on the shore. When the humans of the city cruelly slaughtered the beings, the Water Lizard stirred. On the anniversary of the slaughter, the Water Lizard rose up and utterly destroyed the city, so completely that not even ruins remained. Fearful of its power the Pantokrator banished the creature back below the waves, never to return. Now with the Pantokrator gone it stirs once more and will rise to conquer the land by donning the mantle of God itself."

After serving the Monkey King for many years he became known as a devout and loyal servant of the Pantokrator, serving as messenger for the One True God and aiding him against his enemies. After a particularly difficult battle the Pantokrator offered him a great reward, however the Monkey asked only for a place at his feet to worship him. Touched, the Pantokrator blessed his servant with immortality. One day however, the Pantokrator was gone and his gifts had waned. Bereft, the Divine Monkey has decided to don the yoke of Godhood and lead his people in the battle for Ascension. He is unharmed by flames, can survive under the water and is a competent general of the monkeyfolk. His physical and magical prowess are legendary and he has power over the air, the water and the land."

#descr "The Kami is a giant of divine heritage. The previous Pantokrator created him as a great warrior to defend the lands of the east. When the Pantokrator saw how he was revered by warriors and generals he flew into a rage and imprisoned him for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, he can return to the world to lead his followers in battle against those that would deny the true God. Armed and armoured for battle, he is the patron of fighters and those that act with honour. The Kami wields a demon-slaying spear and a pagoda of light that will intimidate the weak-willed. In battle he will manifest Fire, Earth and Nature gems to aid in spellcasting."

He was given power over the water of the land and the deeps by a previous Pantokrator, however he misused his power to bring floods and devastation. The Pantokrator saw what his servant had wrought and set a great warrior to bind him. The battle that followed raged for many days and nights and ended with the sky being knocked off its axis and causing all rivers to flow to the southeast. After being imprisoned at the bottom of the ocean he has now begun to stir once more. The Lord of Floods can travel below the waves and is feared by all living beings. Now he seeks to become the True God and the world will tremble. In combat he will manifest Water and Earth gems to aid in spellcasting."

#name "Angelic Lord"
#descr "The Angelic Lord is a powerful being from the Celestial Sphere and was the first of the Heavenly Host. Once in the service of the Pantokrator, he was imprisoned after his master became fearful of his power and divine presence. Now the shackles are weakening, and he has chosen to claim this world as his and have heavenly hosts proclaim his glory. The Angelic Lord is surrounded by a divine splendor that must be shielded lest it strike the world with unbearable might. Anyone striking Him will in turn be struck by awe and heavenly fire. He bears a great flaming blade with which he has banished many demons and he will not part with it. In combat he can manifest gems of Fire, Air and Astral magic to aid in spellcasting."

#newmonster 8415 -- Grigori
#copyspr 2066
#name "Grigori"
#descr "At the dawn of time, on the sacred mount Hermon, descended six angels in full celestial splendor to the natives of the holy land to aid and instruct them in righteousness and wisdom. The Avvim were a people strong and beautiful of mind and body. They were adept students and their culture flourished under the tutelage of the Watchers. But before long the Grigori became enamored with the Avvim, shared their burdens and taught them things that should not be taught. Tempted by the beauty of the Avvim, they took their daughters as wives and sinned before the Celestial Powers. Their offspring were the Nephilim, giants of great power, abominable to the world. When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Grigori were banished to the infernal realms. Now, with the Pantokrator gone one of the Grigori can feel his shackles weakening and will return to the world to claim the mantle of Godhood."

#descr "At the beginning of time the Pantokrator created seven angelic beings from his own illumination. Foremost was the Peacock Angel, a being of light itself. Upon creating the first man from the dust of the earth the Pantokrator decreed all the angels must bow before it, however the Peacock Angel refused. He reasoned a being of light should not bow before a creature of the dust. At this the other angels cried out and called him a Devil and a Heretic. The Pantokrator however praised him for seeing the truth and bade him sit at the side of the Throne of Heaven. Now, with the Pantokrator gone the Peacock Angel will take his place and bestow blessings and misfortune as he sees fit. Anyone striking at his glory will in turn be struck by awe and blindness, however the Peacock Angel refuses to cover his splendor. In combat he can manifest gems of Water, Air and Nature magic to aid in spellcasting."

In time he had two daughters, the Morning Star and Evening Star, who would open and close the gates for his great chariot to aid him in his task. As the people of the world saw the life giving rays of the sun they began to worship it above the Pantokrator and he grew jealous of his child. He imprisoned the Sun Father along with his two offspring in a pit from which no light could escape and gave the task of driving the Sun Chariot to another. Now, with the Pantokrator departed, the Sun Father has returned along with his daughters to claim his birthright and ascend the Throne of Heaven. The Sun Father is skilled in all the magic of the skies, whilst his two daughters are skilled in the magic of the dawn and the night sky. His Daughters will lose some magical power whilst away from their Father, however he can call them to him in times of need with but a word."

#name "Lord of Mysteries"
#descr "In ancient times the Pantokrator appointed a single being to watch over the heavens, the earth and the Underworld. This being saw all that occurred, and reported to the Pantokrator each sin committed so that punishment could be assigned. Over time the being grew fond of the creatures over which it watched, and no longer wished to cause them pain and suffering. He took great golden bands and sealed them over his eyes, that he would not be able to see their sins. When the Pantokrator discovered such treachery he bound his servant below the earth for eternity. Now the shackles grow weaker and the Lord of Mysteries can return to the world he covets. He has three heads for watching the three realms, however the golden bands that block his sight cannot be removed. In combat the Lord of Mysteries will manifest gems of air, earth and death to aid in spellcasting."

#descr "The Titan of the Night is a giant of divine heritage. She was born out of chaos in ancient times and claimed dominion over the night and darkness in all its forms. She gave birth to the Keres, the bloodthirsty daimones of the underworld, and rules them as their queen. In time even the Pantokrator grew fearful of her and bound her in a great cave at the entrance to Tartarus. With the Pantokrator gone it is rumoured she may have already broken her chains and stalks the world unseen. The Titan of the Night can become invisible at will, but sometimes appears as a gaunt winged figure robed in bloody garments. The Titan of the Night is more powerful in darkness and her touch can drain the life from the living. Each month her children will bring her slaves of pure blood, and in combat she will manifest a magic pearl and a death gem for use in spellcasting."

Long ago on a distant star they constructed a machine to manifest their very thoughts, making their wishes into reality. Unfortunately in their hubris the Star Spawn failed to account for the dark thoughts that reside in the subconscious mind. When the machine was switched on thoughts born of fear, rage and hatred took the form of invisible demons that stalked and slew their creators until they smashed the great machine that was their lifes work. Alas, the greatest of these creatures was already manifest, a monster born out of their arrogance. Out of fear the Star Spawns began to worship this being formed from their darkest emotions. When the star fell the Illithid hoped they had escaped their tormentor, however this hope was forlorn as the Id Monster has emerged once more. Now it will seize the Throne of Heaven and rule over the creatures of this new world. The Id Monster is naturally invisible but appears for brief moments when enraged. Those nearby feel hatred and fear more strongly, and unrest will increase in the province where it dwells."

Through the ages its followers have grown in confidence and the spirit of the statue has continued to grow in power. Countless offerings later and now with the Pantokrator gone, the Foul Statue has the chance to put the world under its strong dominion and becoming the True God. The statue is tremendously strong in its dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."

It is said to be the ultimate source of all miscreation and abomination in the world. The pool has many tentacles and limbs that grab and devour nearby creatures. The creature has a twisted and cynical mind, and can communicate telepathically with those nearby."

#descr "After the death of the Prophet his remains were kept in the temple of the Holy City of Eldregate and venerated as relics while the nation awaited the coming of the mysteryous New God he had promised. Replicas of the shrouds he wore were made and used by his most devoted followers to heal the sick and wounded, and faithful from all around the Empire made pilgrimages to to Eldregate to offer prayers and sacrifices to the Prophet's tomb. As the focus of such devotion the Reliquary gained great spiritual power. One day as many followers of the New Faith were praying it suddenly began to shine with celestial light. More and stronger miracles manifested, and it was clear a powerful spirit had bound itself to the remains. The Bishops were quick to declare the New God they had been waiting for had awakened, and it was the Prophet himself who had ascended to the Celestial sphere after his death to wait for the time when the faith of the people would be strong enough to call him back to the world, and make him into the God he had promised.
Now Ermor follows the Second Coming of the Prophet, confident that he will lead the Empire to glory and dominion over the whole world."

The goal was resurrect the Prophet, for many had come to believe that he would bring an age of wealth and prosperity where Ermor held ultimate dominion over the world.
However the ritual failed catastrophically: there was no resurrection but rather the spiritual barriers between the worlds of the dead and the living were shattered and Death was brought forth, killing tens of thousands.
Now a powerful spirit of the Underworld is bound to the Prophet's tomb, turning the land to ash and desolation as its dominion spread.
The Unholy Reliquary is surrounded by a terrifying life-draining aura and because of its close connection to the Underworld generates two Death gems every month."

When the Pantokrator banished a wayward servant the spirit petitioned for forgiveness, and for its impudence was bound in a huge statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshipped as a reawakening god.

Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Gate has the chance to put the world under its strong dominion and become the True God.
